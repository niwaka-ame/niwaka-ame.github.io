I used to be a big fan of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raiden_(video_game)][Raiden]] and was able to get Raiden II working on my Retropie during the pandemic.
Today, after several some weeks of hard work, I feel like playing this classic again.
But I forgot which ROM and emulator I used before.
Tonight after some trial and error I find this [[https://www.retrostic.com/pt/roms/mame/raiden-ii-40996][ROM]] (Raiden II, US, Set 1) and it runs on the ~lr-fbneo~ emulator on Retropie.
The only thing I need to do is to copy this ROM to this directory
#+begin_src
~/Retropie/roms/fba
#+end_src
and the game should work out of the box!
