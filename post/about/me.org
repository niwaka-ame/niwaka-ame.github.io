#+title: Me

Hello, my name is Yu Huo.

I am currently a PhD student in systems biology at the University of Edinburgh.

I ‚ù§ Emacs.

Why am I maintaining this blog?
Mainly just for fun.
Other reasons include:
1. contents on blogs being more searchable on the web than social media;
2. the length and format of my writing not being restricted;
3. marking down how I did something for my future reference, which may be incidentally useful to somebody else.
