#+title: How did I build this blog with Org Mode /only/?

* Motivation
As a daily user of Org Mode, I want a minimalistic blogging workflow with Org Mode, without too many overheads in hacking and maintaining and with minimal knowledge of HTML.
While it's possible to combine Org Mode with Jekyll or Hugo, it seems blogging with the built-in ~org-publish~ module to me is good enough.

* Understanding how ~org-publish~ works
I started with this [[https://gitlab.com/pages/org-mode][example Org Mode website]] on GitLab pages.
In this example, each post is a single ~org~ file in the base directory of the website and the job of ~publish.el~ is to call ~org-publish~, which converts the ~org~ files into HTML pages and automatically generates a sitemap (which is the index page in this example).

By looking into the details of ~publish.el~, I found that the major part is the variable ~org-publish-project-alist~, which basically contains all information required to build a website, and some of its most important properties[fn:1] are:
+ ~:base-directory~ tells ~org-publish~ where to find the ~org~ files to publish;
+ ~:publishing-directory~ defines where the converted HTML files should go;
+ ~:auto-sitemap~ and ~:sitemap-filename~ decide whether I want an automatically generated sitemap and where it should go.
See [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Project-alist.html][this part of the Org Manual]] for an exhausted list of properties.

[fn:1] Strictly speaking, the properties of each element (project) in ~org-publish-project-alist~, because the ~alist~ may hold more than one projects.

* Customising my blog
I cloned the repo above and successfully built it. Yay!
This is essentially what I want --- an index page with links to all posts, and each post as a single HTML page.
Then, the next thing is to customise it mostly by changing property values in ~org-publish-project-alist~.

** My config file
Below, I'll only show snippets of my blog's config.
The whole config is [[../../misc/blog.el][here]].
I am using [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs][Doom Emacs]], so my config is actually in ~.doom.d/config.el~.

** Repo structure

I want to keep the original ~org~ files, published HTML files and other files (e.g. images) inside a single repo.
So the basic structure of my repo looks like this:

#+begin_src shell :exports results
tree -d ~/blog -L 1
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: /home/yu/blog
: ├── misc # other files (e.g. images)
: ├── post # org files
: └── public # html files

*** Tags or subfolders?

Ideally, I'd like my blog to support a tagging system, so each post can be assigned multiple tags, and visitors can view contents by various tags.
This is seen in [[https://alhassy.github.io/AlBasmala.html][this example]], but it's not simple.
The benefit of tags will only emerge with more posts, so I will implement it only when it becomes necessary.

Alternatively, for now, I use subfolders to categorise my posts.
For example, now I have two categories of posts.
#+begin_src shell :exports results
tree -d ~/blog/post -L 1
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: /home/yu/blog/post
: ├── about
: └── emacs

Accordingly, I have the following settings:
#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-publish-project-alist
      (list (list "post"
                  ;; ... other properties
                  :recursive t
                  :sitemap-style 'tree
                  ;; ...
                  )))
#+end_src
such that the ~public~ folder mirrors the structure of the ~post~ folder:
#+begin_src shell :exports results
tree -d ~/blog -L 2
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
/home/yu/blog
├── misc
├── post
│   ├── about
│   └── emacs
└── public
    ├── about
    └── emacs
#+end_example
and the [[../../index.html][homepage]] shows the tree structure of my blog.

** Styling

By default, the styling of exported HTML pages is minimal.
I want my blog to look more attractive and include necessary information/links at the top and bottom of the page.

*** CSS
CSS controls the looking of the website, whilst being agnostic of its content.
I found a minimal CSS setting, [[https://simplecss.org/][Simple.css]] from System Crafters' [[https://systemcrafters.net/publishing-websites-with-org-mode/building-the-site/#improving-the-page-styling][post]] (which is amazing).
To use it, I include the following line in my config:
#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-html-head "<link href=\"https://cdn.simplecss.org/simple.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" />")
#+end_src

Another CSS setting that is worth mentioning is [[http://taopeng.me/org-notes-style/][org-notes-style]].

*** Preamble
I want to keep preambles as simple as possible --- that is, just a link back to my homepage:
#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-publish-project-alist
      (list (list "post"
                  ;; ... other properties
                  :html-link-up "/"
                  :html-link-home "/"
                  ;; ...
                  )))
#+end_src
For some reason, the "UP" and "HOME" links always appear together, so I set both of them to point to homepage.

*** Postamble
I adapted a postamble from  [[https://ravi.pro/blog/blogging-with-emacs-org-mode.html#orgac49a03][Ravi Sagar]]:
#+begin_src elisp
(defvar my-html-blog-postamble
  "<div class='footer'> © Yu Huo 2022. Created %d, Last updated %C, built with %c</div>")

(setq org-publish-project-alist
      (list (list "post"
                  ;; ... other properties
                  :html-postamble my-html-blog-postamble
                  ;; ...
                  )))
#+end_src

*** Sitemap entry format
The default sitemap entry doesn't show date of each post, and it doesn't work after I set the ~:sitemap-file-entry-format~ property to ~"%d *%t*"~, either.

So I adapted a sitemap entry format from [[https://ravi.pro/blog/blogging-with-emacs-org-mode.html#orgac49a03][Ravi Sagar]] again.
I modified it such that it works for tree-style sitemap and capitalises titles.
#+begin_src elisp
(defun my-format-entry (entry style project)
  (if (file-directory-p (org-publish--expand-file-name entry project))
      (format "%s" (capitalize (substring entry 0 -1)))
    (format "[[file:%s][%s]] --- %s"
            entry
            (capitalize (org-publish-find-title entry project))
            (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d" (org-publish-find-date entry project)))))

(setq org-publish-project-alist
      (list (list "post"
                  ;; ... other properties
                  :sitemap-format-entry #'my-format-entry
                  ;; ...
                  )))
#+end_src

* Testing
** Making a test page
I extensively use Org Mode's [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Markup-for-Rich-Contents.html][markup for rich contents]], for example, bold, italic and embedded LaTeX.
To see if those markups can be properly exported, I set up a [[./test.org][test page]] for markups that I use most.

** Hosting locally
I want live preview of the outcome of various tests.
Instead of directly opening the exported HTML file, I use [[https://github.com/skeeto/emacs-web-server][simple-httpd]] to locally host the website in Emacs, as recommended by [[https://systemcrafters.net/publishing-websites-with-org-mode/building-the-site/#previewing-the-generated-site][System Crafters]].

** Forcing sitemap to update
One issue that I encountered while testing is that the sitemap won't automatically update after I change my post's title and re-build.
I realised that it's an issue with ~org-publish~ caching the post's title in ~org-publish-cache~.
Following this [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/44534/org-mode-sitemap-not-updated-after-re-publish][solution]], I cleaned the cache and rebuild the blog by running:
#+begin_src elisp
(org-publish-remove-all-timestamps)
(org-publish "site" t)
#+end_src
As pointed out in the comment, this is probably a feature to speed up sitemap generation.

* Hosting on Github Pages
With my blog pretty much behaving as desired, it's time to host it somewhere and start writing!
Again to minimise overheads, I chose to host my blog on [[https://pages.github.com/][Github Pages]].

** Dummy ~index.html~ file
The only issue is that Github Pages requires an ~index.html~ file at the root of my repo, so following this [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25320356/can-i-have-my-github-pages-index-html-in-a-subfolder-of-the-repository][solution]] I created a dummy html file.
