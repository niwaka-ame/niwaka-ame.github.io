<p>
After arriving at Tweedbank, we walked to Melrose along the River Tweed.
It is now February and was quite cold in the morning.
It took us a while to get warm by walking, and the scenery was quite bleak at the beginning,
but the sound of the water flow and the scenery mirrored inside brought liveliness.

<h2 id="org3edeac8"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> The Eildon Hills</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
We managed to top two of the three peaks (Mid and North).
Although the weather was fine, the way to the top was sometimes quite muddy, but it wasn&rsquo;t too bad for Scotland in February!
We saw layers and layers of mountains on the northwest direction, and a stunning viaduct, Leaderfoot Viaduct, on the northeast.
On the way back we passed by Newstead, the earliest human inhabitant in Scotland dating back to Roman times, which was then called <i>Trimontinum</i>.

<h2 id="org16ee214"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> The Melrose Abbey</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
We also visited the Melrose Abbey, a huge Gothic architechture built in the 12th century.
Similar to the Notre-Dame of Paris, the high nave is supported by the &ldquo;flying buttresses&rdquo; from above the roofs of the aisles, which was the state-of-art architectural technique at that time.
Multiple sculptures still survive, including a bagpipe-playing pig.

<h2 id="org5164299"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> The rosy sky, quietness, and bird quintet</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
The sky turned rosy when we headed back to Tweedbank, and so does the river.
What a day&#x2026;
there was a moment of complete quietness on the Eildon Hills, and another moment of bird quintet after sunset which made us feel that spring had arrived.
I don&rsquo;t know for how long I&rsquo;ll stay in Scotland, but I&rsquo;ll miss it &#x2014; given that even in the bleak Scottish February, lovely sceneries are still in wait for witness.
