#+title: Me

Hello, my name is Yu Huo.

I am currently a PhD student in systems biology at the University of Edinburgh.

I ‚ù§ Emacs.

Why am I maintaining my blog?
Mainly just for fun.
Other reasons include:
1. searching contents on blogs being easier than on social media;
2. the length and format of my writing not being restricted;
3. marking down how I did something for my future reference, which may be incidentally useful to somebody else.

My blog does not support comments, but feel free to contact me at: yhuo ~at~ tuta ~dot~ io
