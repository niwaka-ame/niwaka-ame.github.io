#+TITLE: Yu Huo

Welcome to my personal blog.

I am a finishing PhD student in systems biology at the University of Edinburgh.
I am most interested in microbiology, computation and software development, and will work on the interfaces between the three.

I use [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]] daily and this blog was edited and built with [[https://orgmode.org/][Orgmode]] in Emacs.
In this blog, I mostly write about how I use my computer, and sometimes happy moments in my life.

This is a simple, static blog which doesn't support comments, but please feel free to contact me at: yhuo ~at~ tuta ~dot~ io.
