#+title: Syncing Zotero with cloud storage like Google Drive
#+date:<2023-05-27 Sat>

Zotero is an amazing tool for literature management (and more) --- a free and open-source software (FOSS) that enables much more flexibility in my workflow than, e.g. Mendeley.

I work on multiple PCs and need to sync the metadata and the PDFs of literature between them.
Zotero provides 300 MB free storage for each user, which is enough for syncing metadata but not PDFs.
They provide subscription plans (e.g. 2GB storage for $20/year), which is a reasonable price, and more importantly, by subcription we support the development of Zotero.

However, for students who have no income but free Google Drive-like cloud storage by the university, it is possible to sync metadata via Zotero and the (bulky) PDFs via another cloud storage.
Tom Saunders used to have a step-by-step [[https://tomsaunders.co.nz/zotero-with-google-drive/][blog post]] about this, but his blog is currently not available.
So, I decided to re-write one, largely based on what he has done.

* Installing ZotFile and Better BibTeX
This workflow requires two amazing Zotero add-ons: [[http://zotfile.com/][ZotFile]] and [[https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/][Better BibTeX]].

Zotero add-ons are ~.xpi~ files, the same as Firefox's, which confuses Firefox if you left-click the link to download.
So, if you download with Firefox, right-click on the link and choose ~Save link as...~ instead of left-clicking.

To install the add-ons, go to Zotero's ~Tools~ menu and select ~Add-ons~.
In the new dialog, click on the "gear" button and choose ~Install Add-on From File...~ and choose the ~.xpi~ file.
Restart Zotero after installation.

* In Zotero's preference dialog
Go to the ~Edit~ menu at the top and choose ~Preference~.
In the new dialog, choose ~Sync~ and register/log into your Zotero account.
After login, the dialog should look like this:
[[../../misc/screenshots/sync-zotero/sync.png]]
Follow the step numbers in the screenshot to untick those boxes.

* In ZotFile's preference dialog
Go to the ~Tools~ menu at the top and choose ~ZotFile Preferences...~.
The new dialog should look like this:
[[../../misc/screenshots/sync-zotero/zotfile-1.png]]
Choose a custom location --- *this folder will be the folder to be synced via a non-Zotero cloud storage*, which stores all PDFs.
Then go to ~Renaming Rules~ and change the following:
[[../../misc/screenshots/sync-zotero/zotfile-2.png]]
where ~{%b}~ means the PDF names are decided by the cite keys generated by Better BibTex.

Now, Zotero should sync metadata via its own cloud storage but store the PDFs locally.
You should set up another cloud storage to sync the folder containing the PDFs.
Repeat this process on another PC and you'll get the library synced on both machines!
