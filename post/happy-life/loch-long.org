#+title: Loch Long: a Scottish fjord

It was again a day trip from Edinburgh.
I walked with a friend the final part of the [[https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/lochlomond/three-lochs-way.shtml][Three Lochs Way]], which begins in Garelochhead on Gare Loch, passes Loch Long and finishes in Tarbet on Loch Lomond.
Also, I realised that Loch Long is a fjord!
Isn't it surprising that we can do a day trip to a fjord from Edinburgh?

Itinerary: Edinburgh ~--train-->~ Garelochhead ~--walk-->~ Arrochar ~--walk-->~ Tarbet ~--train-->~ Edinburgh
